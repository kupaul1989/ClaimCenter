// PLWEB-5487: Usually the item-over (aka focus) color takes precedence over the selected color, making it hard to
// distinguish when an item with a mouse/keyboard focus is also selected.  This could lead to incorrectly assuming that
// clicking the shuttle button will do something.  Now, we mix the two colors so that there is a visual indication of
// both highlighted and selected, thereby removing any chance of confusion
